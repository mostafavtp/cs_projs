# Description
This program save text data or file data on image.
Saved image format is PNG because it must be lossless.
I save one bit per color. One bit in red, one bit in blue and one bit in green. So I save 3 bits in each pixel.
Then for example to save 1MB data, you need more than 3 Mpixel image.
The result image quality is good and it does not change noticeable.

It is simple to use:

To save data:
  1. Click on "..." button to select an image.
  2. Click on "Write File Data On Image" button to select a file.
  3. Click on "SaveImage" button to save the PNG image.

To restore data:
  1. Click on "..." button to select an image that previously saved by this program.
  2. Click on "Read Data From Image" button to save the data file.
  
That's it.
