# Description
This program hide text or file data on image.

Saved image format is PNG because it must be lossless.

I save one bit per color. One bit in red, one bit in blue and one bit in green. So I save 3 bits in each pixel.
Then to save n bytes of data you need (n * 8 / 3 + header_data) Pixels. For example to save 1MB data, you need more than (1 * 1024 * 1024 * 8 / 3) pixels, aproximately 2.8 Mpixel image.

The result image quality is good and the changes is not senseable.

It is simple to use:

Run the program (direct executable file link: https://github.com/mostafavtp/cs_projs/blob/master/DataOnImage/release/DataOnImage.exe . It built by .Net framework 4.0 that exist on most windows systems) Then:

To save data:
  1. Click on "..." button to select an image.
  2. Click on "Write File Data On Image" button to select a file.
  3. Click on "SaveImage" button to save the PNG image.

To restore data:
  1. Click on "..." button to select an image that previously saved by this program.
  2. Click on "Read Data From Image" button to save the data file.
  
That's it.
